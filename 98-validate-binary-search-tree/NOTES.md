Approach:
* We will do an in-order traversal going for left subtree then right subtree.
* While going for left subtree from root, all nodes of left subtree (If BST) must be lesser than root.
* While going for right subtree from root, all nodes of right subtree (If BST) must be greater than root.
* Taking Long to cover some additional test cases
